# Nanoscale hydrodynamics near solids

This repository contains most of the work that I did throughout the four years I spent working in my Ph.D.

If you are only interested in the dissertation, I recommend you to visit [this website](http://62.204.194.43/fez/view/tesisuned:ED-Pg-Ciencias-Dduque), where you can download the entire file in pdf format.


I would have liked to clean the code contained in the jupyter notebooks. Maybe it is not readable enough, but I did my best with the little time that every phd candidate has along in his/her last year. Hope it would be useful. 


Because GitHub does not admit files larger than 100.00 MB, all the necessary files to run the notebooks are not included. 

## Topics

* Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. 
* Coarse-Graining Theory.
* Statistical Physics. 
* Nanohydrodynamics. 


## Software and tools

* To perform MD simulations I used [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/).
* To obtain mesoscopic information from the simulations my group developed the [CG-Method](UNEDSoftMatter/CG-Method). Almost all the code was written by [@hiperones](https://github.com/hiperones).
* Python was my predilect language to translate the theory to code. And Jupyter notebooks my [panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon) to visualize the results.
