It was in the nineteen century when the Statistical Mechanics (SM) was born mainly because of the work of Ludwing Boltzmann and Josiah Willard Gibbs. The goal was to reconcile the Thermodynamics with the microscopic laws. 

Thermodynamics was well-established because it draws its concepts from experiments while the attemps to understand it from the Newton's laws collided with problems such as the imposibility of taking into account the interactions between all the particles of a thermodynamic system, the highly nontrivial of theses interactions, the huge number of degrees of freedom or the Loschmidt's paradox\footnote{The second law of thermodynamics establishes that the entropy of an isolated system increases with time. This can be understood as a time direction imposed by the increasing of the entropy. Furthermore, Newton's laws are reversible. According to Josef Loschmidt this apparently conflict could be the responsible of the imposibility to derive the laws of the thermodynamics from the microscopic laws.}. 
To avoid these problems physicist realized that the macro properties of a thermodynamic system does not strongly depend on the exact dynamics of every particle, but more on the averages that eventually polish the details of the behaviour of the particles. 
Thus, the link between the microscopic and macroscopic theory of matter can be stated appling statistical techniques to the microscopical mechanics laws. 
The connection is posible to the notion of \textit{ensemble}, which is a collection of imaginary systems with a set of common macroscopic properties.  

In this way we may define SM as a theoretical framework which allows to study the macro-properties of a many-body system from the dynamics of its microcopic constituents.
Therefore, we may roughly say that SM acts as a bridge between two levels of description: microscopic level governed by the Newton's laws of motion and the macroscopic level in which the knowledge is adquired from the experiments.
A beautiful but rough example about how SM works can be found in the latter book of Dean Rickles, {\it Philosophy of Physics} \cite{Rickles2016}.
He imagines a large musical ensemble playing in concert.
The ``global'' sound produced by the musicians is analogue to the thermodynamic variables obtained from the colisions between the particles in the system. 
The music can me analized from two levels: the global level, where the harmony and the musical form take an important role, and the individual level, in which we focus in what the musicians are playing to produce the global sound. ``In this zooming in and out'', in words of Rickles, ``from the whole system to its parts, that characterizes the relationship between statistical mechanics and thermodynamics: you won't see harmonies in a single bassoon; likewise, you won't see pressure or temperature in an individual molecule.''

The equilibrium theory of SM provides an interpretation for the equilibrium thermodynamic systems from a molecular point of view. The models that allow us to reproduce real systems are the well-known microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensembles. These ensembles are idealizations. They does not reproduce exactly real experiments, but give us useful information about them. 
However, most of the phenomena present in the Nature are in non-equilibrium in the time scale of our observation. A non-equilibrium system may be modeled perturbating an equilibrium ensemble that forces the system to not relax to equilibrium.  
Einstein \cite{Einstein1905}, Onsager \cite{Onsager1931} and Kirkwood \cite{Kirkwood1946} made important contributions to Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics (NESM) years before Green \cite{Green1952, Green1954}, in the fifties, formulated it as we know nowadays. 
It was in the 60's when Zwanzig \cite{Zwanzig1961} and Mori \cite{Mori1965} reformulated the theory using the technique of the projection operators \cite{Grabert1982}. 


\section{Hamilton's equations and the evolution of the microstates}
Consider a system consisting of $N$ particles of mass $m$ in a volume $V$. 
In CM the positions of the particles ${\bf q}^N\equiv ({\bf q}_1,\dots,{\bf q}_N)^T$ and their 3N momenta ${\bf p}^N\equiv ({\bf p}_1,\dots,{\bf p}_N)^T$ specify the state of the system at any time. 
The collection of the positions and momenta of the particles defines the microscopic state of the system, $z=(q,p)^T$, which is a {\it phase point} in the {\it phase space} $\Gamma$ of 6N dimensions. 
The notation emphasized that $z$ is a column vector, where $T$ is the transpose. 
Therefore, the time evolution of a phase point $z_t$ is called the {\it phase trajectory} and it is determined by the Hamilton's equations of motion

\begin{equation}
    \dot{{\bf q}}_i = \frac{\partial \hat{H}}{\partial {\bf p}_i}, \dot{{\bf p}}_i = -\frac{\partial \hat{H}}{\partial {\bf q}_i}
  \label{HamiltonEqs}
\end{equation}

Typically the Hamiltonian has the form
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}(z) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{{\bf p}_i^2}{2m}+\hat{U}({\bf q}_1,\dots,{\bf q}_N)+\sum_{i=1}^{N}\Phi({\bf q}_i),
\end{align}

where the first sum is the kinetic energy of the system, the potential of interaction
between particles is $\hat{U}({\bf q}_1,\dots,{\bf q}_N)$ and $\Phi({\bf r})$ is a time-independent external potential. 

Note that the the phase trajectories can not pass through the same point of the phase space because the evolution of the phase point is subject to 6N initial conditions. 
Thus, if two trajectories in phase space cross is because they started at the same phase point.  

Hamilton's equations can be written in compact form as
\begin{align}
  \dot{z}_t = J\cdot\frac{\partial\hat{H}}{\partial{z}}(z_t)\equiv \hat{v}(z_t),
  \label{compactHamiltonEqs}
\end{align}

where we have defined the Hamiltonian vector field $\hat{v}(z_t)$ and $J$ is the symplectic matrix\footnote{J is an orthogonal matriz, $J^TJ=1\to J^T = J^{-1}$, and its square is the minus the identity matrix $J^2=-1$} with the form
$$
\begin{pmatrix} 
  0 & +1_{3N} \\
  -1_{3N} & 0 
\end{pmatrix},
$$
where $1_{3N}$ is the identity matrix of dimension $3N \times 3N$.

Hamilton's equation (\ref{compactHamiltonEqs}) indicates that the trajectory of $z_t$ in phase space is an integral curve of the velocity field. Therefore, if we follow the indications given by the velocity field we can figure out which microstate will be the next one. 


\subsection{Linear Hamilton's equations}
We have presented Hamilton's equations as a {\it set of non-linear ordinary differential equations}. However, in the language of linear operators we may obtain linear equations that are amenable of theoretical treatment. 

By analogy with Quantum Mechanics (QM) we consider all functions $\hat{B}(z)$ in phase space as a Hilbert vector space. 
Each function $\hat{B}(z)$ is a vector in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space vector. 
As well as the state vector in QM, $|\Psi\rangle$, each function (vector) $\hat{B}$ has the dimension of all the possible microstates in which the system might be. 
The identity function in phase space is denoted as $\hat{z}$. It takes any microstate $z$ into $\hat{z}(z)=z$. 
We carefuly distinguish the argument $z$, which is a point in the phase space, from the vector of the Hilbert space $\hat{z}$, which represents the identity function.

The {\it Liouville operator} $i{\cal L}$ is an important operator in the dynamics of the microstatates. It has the following explicit form 
\begin{equation}
    i{\cal L} = -
    \sum_i\left[\frac{\partial \hat{H}}{\partial {\bf q}_i}
\frac{\partial    }{\partial {\bf p}_i}-
\frac{\partial \hat{H}}{\partial {\bf p}_i}
\frac{\partial }{\partial {\bf q}_i}\right]
\label{iL}
\end{equation}
In order to give a more compact form of the action of the Liouville operator on a phase function we introduce the Poisson bracket
\begin{align}
  \{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\equiv\left(\frac{\partial\hat{A}}{\partial z}\right)^T\cdot J\cdot\frac{\partial\hat{B}}{\partial z}= 
  \sum_i\left[\frac{\partial \hat{A}}{\partial {\bf q}_i}
    \frac{\partial \hat{B}}{\partial {\bf p}_i}-          
    \frac{\partial \hat{A}}{\partial {\bf p}_i}
  \frac{\partial\hat{B} }{\partial {\bf q}_i}\right]
    \label{PoissonBracket}
\end{align}
%\begin{align}
%  \{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\equiv\left(\frac{\partial\hat{A}}{\partial z}\right)^T\cdot J\cdot\frac{\partial\hat{B}}{\partial z}= 
%  \sum_i\left[\frac{\partial \hat{A}}{\partial {\bf q}_i}
%    \frac{\partial \hat{B}}{\partial {\bf p}_i}-          
%    \frac{\partial \hat{A}}{\partial {\bf p}_i}
%  \frac{\partial\hat{B} }{\partial {\bf q}_i}\right]
%    \label{PoissonBracket}
%\end{align}
Therefore, taking an arbitrary phase function $\hat{B}(z)$ the Liouville operator acts on it in this way
%\begin{align}
%  i{\cal L}\hat{B}=-\left(\frac{\partial\hat{H}}{\partial z}\right)^T\cdot J\cdot\frac{\partial\hat{B}}{\partial z}
%  =\hat{v}^T\cdot\frac{\partial\hat{B}}{\partial z}
%  = \frac{\partial^T}{\partial z}\cdot\left(\hat{H}\hat{B}\right) 
%  = -\{\hat{H},\hat{B}\}
%  \label{iLB}
%\end{align}
\begin{equation}
  i{\cal L}\hat{B} 
%  =-    \sum_i\left[\frac{\partial \hat{H}}{\partial {\bf q}_i}
%      \frac{\partial\hat{B}}{\partial {\bf p}_i}-
%\frac{\partial \hat{H}}{\partial {\bf p}_i}
%\frac{\partial\hat{B} }{\partial {\bf q}_i}\right]
%=-\left(\frac{\partial\hat{H}}{\partial z}\right)^T\cdot J\cdot\frac{\partial\hat{B}}{\partial z}
  = -\{\hat{H},\hat{B}\}
\label{iL}
\end{equation}

Where we have introduce the {\it Poisson bracket} to give a more compact form of the action of the Liouville operator on a phase function. 

%In order to give a more compact form of the action of the Liouville operator on a phase function we have introduced the Poisson bracket
%\begin{align}
%  \{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\equiv\left(\frac{\partial\hat{A}}{\partial z}\right)^T\cdot J\cdot\frac{\partial\hat{B}}{\partial z}=

%    \frac{\partial \hat{B}}{\partial {\bf p}_i}-          
%    \frac{\partial \hat{A}}{\partial {\bf p}_i}
%  \frac{\partial\hat{B} }{\partial {\bf q}_i}\right]
%    \label{PoissonBracket}
%\end{align}

The action of the Liouville operator on the identity function $\hat{z}$ is
\begin{align}
  i{\cal L} \hat{z} = \hat{v}
  \label{iLz}
\end{align}

Therefore, in the language of the Liouville operator we can transform a complicated nonlinear function $\hat{v}$ into the action of a linear operator $i{\cal L}$ on the identity function $z$.

With the Eq. (\ref{iLz}) the Hamilton's equations (\ref{compactHamiltonEqs}) can be written in terms of the Liouville operator as
\begin{align}
  \frac{d}{dt}z_t=i{\cal L}\hat{z}(z_t)
  \label{Devzt}
\end{align}

In order to obtain an expresion for $z_t$ we consider a Taylor expansion of the trajectory $z_t$ around $t=0$, this is
\begin{align}
    z_t=z_0+\frac{dz_t}{dt}(0)t+\frac{1}{2!}\frac{d^2z_t}{dt^2}(0)t^2+\cdots
    \label{ztExp}
\end{align}
From (\ref{Devzt}) we have the first order derivative. All the high order time derivatives are given by
\begin{align}
    &\frac{d^2z_t}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt}i{\cal L}\hat{z}(z_t)
    =\hat{v}^T(z_t)\cdot\frac{\partial i{\cal L}\hat{z}}{\partial z}(z_t)
    =(i{\cal L})^2\hat{z}(z_t) \nonumber \\ 
    &\vdots \nonumber \\ 
    &\frac{d^n z_t}{dt^n} =(i{\cal L})^n\hat{z}(z_t)
\end{align}

Evaluating all these time derivatives at $t=0$, the Eq. (\ref{ztExp}) becomes
\begin{align}
    z_t=\hat{z}(z_0)+i{\cal L}\hat{z}(z_0)t
    +\frac{1}{2!}(i{\cal L}^2)\hat{z}(z_0)
    +\cdots
    ={\rm exp}\{i{\cal L}t\}\hat{z}(z_0),
    \label{zt1}
\end{align}
where the exponential operator can be defined as a Taylor expansion

\begin{align}
  {\rm exp}(i{\cal L}t) \equiv {\cal I} + i{\cal L}t + \frac{1}{2!}(i{\cal L}t)^2 + \frac{1}{3!}(i{\cal L}t)^3 +  \frac{1}{4!}(i{\cal L}t)^4 + \cdots,
\end{align}
where ${\cal I}$ is the identity operator.
The notation of the time evolution equation (\ref{zt1}) is usually simplified in this way 
\begin{align}
  z_t = exp\{i{\cal L}t\}z_0
  \label{zt}
\end{align}
without forgetting that what we are doing is to apply an operator ${\rm exp}\{i{\cal L}t\}$ to a phase function $\hat{z}$, giving as a result ${\rm exp}\{i{\cal L}t\}\hat{z}$, and then evaluate this result at the value $z_0$.


\section{The Liouville theorem}
We have seen that Hamilton's equations (\ref{compactHamiltonEqs}) are first order differential equations governing the deterministic evolution of the system. 
These equations need an initial condition $z_0$, which is impossible to know because in general we have not access to the position and momenta of every single particle in the system. Usually, a system is prepared under identical macroscopic conditions that do not allow to fix the value of the initial condition. 
Different configurations of the particles can give an identical macroscopic condition. 
This reason enforces the introduction of a {\it probability density} $\rho_0(z)$ which let us to express our knowledge about the initial microscopic of the system in a statistical way. The probability distribution in phase space is usually referred to as an {\it ensemble}. One can imagine an ensemble as a collection of systems with equal macroscopic properties but different microscopic configurations.
Note that even though the evolution of $z_t$ is deterministic, the introduction of a probability density converts the evolution in phase space into a stochastic process.
The lack of knowledge of the initial condition and the introduction of the probability density at the initial time produce uncertainty on the microstates at subsequent times. Therefore, we introduce the probability distribution function at a subsequent time $\rho_t(z)$.
This allows us to know at any point in time how the systems of an ensemble are distributed in the phase space.

The probability that a system is in a microscopic state at a time $t$ represented by a 6N-dimensional phase point dz is $\rho_t(z)dz$. And $\rho_t(z)$ satisfies:
\begin{align}
    \rho_t(z) \geq 0  \nonumber \\
    \int dz\rho_t(z) = 1
\end{align}

The equation that governs the evolution of the probability density is the {\it Liouville equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\rho_t(z)}{\partial t} + \sum_{i=1}^N\left(\frac{\partial\rho_t(z)}{\partial{\bf q}_i}\cdot{\bf \dot{q}}_i+\frac{\partial\rho_t(z)}{\partial{\bf p}_i}\cdot{\bf \dot{p}}_i\right) = 0
\end{equation}
We may express this equation in a more compact way using the Liouville operator (\ref{iL}) 
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial\rho_t(z)}{\partial t} = -i{\cal L}\rho_t(z)
  \label{LiouvilleEq}
\end{align}
Therefore, the time evolution of the probability density is
\begin{align}
    \rho_t(z) = {\rm exp}\{-i{\cal L}t\}\rho_0(z)
    \label{rhot}
\end{align}
Note that we may express the Lioville equation (\ref{LiouvilleEq}) in the following form
\begin{align}
    \frac{d\rho_t(z)}{dt} = 0 
    \label{LiouvilleTh}
\end{align}
This is called the {\it Liouville theorem}. It shows that if we take a volume in the phase space bounded by a surface and we follow it during time evolution, we will observe that the surface will move and so do the points (microstates) inside the surface but the volume will remain the same. The reason is that the phase trajectories can not cross because this implies that they started at the same point. In other words: the volume in phase space must be conserved, as we can see in Fig. \ref{fig:LiouvilleTh}.

\section{The Theory of Coarse-Graining and the CG variables}
The Theory of Coarse-Graining (ToCG) consists on eliminate the ``useless'' information about a system in order to have a simplified version described by a set of selected variables with time scales much larger than the typical molecular scales. 
We may acquire a lot of information about the system during the simplification process because we have to separate the essential details from the irrelevant ones. 
%Frase copiada del libro de Pep 
%In the simplication process we may acquire a lot of information about the system by focusing in the essential details and not being distracted by overwhelming number of irrelevant details.

%Referencia Theory of simple liquids
One of the advantages of the ToCG is to allow to simulated systems with a computer that otherwise it would not be possible or would be computationally expensive. 
This is because we only not gain in terms of a reduction of the number of particles, but also on the possibility to explore longer time scales. 
Think about a system which its constituents have different scales of length and time.
For example, colloidal suspensions are dispersions of mesoscopic particles suspended in a molecula solvent.
The dimensions of the particles are of the order of tens or hundreds nanometers and they move in time scales of nanoseconds or microseconds, whereas the dimensions of the molecules of the solvent are a fraction of a nanometer (for example, in the case of a molecule of water typically of the order of $0.21$ nm) and their time scales are of the order of picoseconds. To treat this kind of asymmetric systems from a microscopic point of view is unworkable with methods such as molecular dynamics simulation, but if our interest resides on the mesoscopic behaviour the problem is hightly simplified using coarse-graining techniques.    

%Copiado del libro de Pep
A system may be described at different {\it levels of description} depending on the amount of information which one retains macroscopically. The state of a system at a given level of description is described by a set of {\it coarse grained variables} (CG variables), which are functions of the microscopic state $z$ of the system and, therefore, are phase functions $\hat{A}(z)$. 
%The symbol $\hat{A}(z)$ denotes a collection of phase functions each one labeled with a discrete index. 
%For example, $\hat{A}=\{\hat{A}_{\mu}(z), \mu=1,\cdots, M\}$. Also, we will consider phase functions that are fields $\hat{A}=\{\hat{A}_{\bf r}(z), {\bf r}\in\mathbb{R}^3\}$ and we understand that the CG variables are labeled with a continuum indes ${\bf r}$. 

The identification of the CG variables is the most important step in the ToCG in order to describe macroscopically a system with many degrees of freedom. There are few guiding principles for the identification of the CG variables such as select the dynamic invariants of the system or observe the features of the system because maybe there is a variable that captures that feature \cite{Karttunen2004}.

Different levels of description gives us different amount of information. Coarser levels have a smaller number of variables (slow variables) and in consecuence captures less information. On the other hand, in fine levels the number of variables is so hight that allow to capture too much information. Therefore, depending on the interests the choose of a level of description will change. A coarse level can describe phenomena that occur at time scales equal or larger than the typical time scale of the level, but it cannot reproduce the behaviour at shorter time scales.

There are two levels of description particulary important: {\it the microcopic and macroscopic levels}. 
The microscopic level has the position and momenta of all particles of the system as the set of variables characterizing the state of the system. 
The equation that governs the evolution of the CG variables are the Hamilton's equations (\ref{compactHamiltonEqs}) and the time scale is the typical collision or vibration time. 
The macroscopic level is the level of Thermodynamics. The CG variables at this level are the dynamical invariants of the system. Because these variables are constant in time and the time scale is infinite there is not a dynamic equation for them.  %E, V, M, T
Between these two levels there is the {\it mesoscopic level}, in which the coarse level is included.

The main objetive of the ToCG is to derive the dynamic equations of the CG variables. Two ideas allow us for the derivation of the dynamic equations: quasi-equilibrium and separation of time scales.

\subsection{Quasi-equilibrium and separation of time scales}
%Two ice cubes are melting inside a glass of water while I am writting this notes. 
Imagine two ice cubes melting inside a glass of water. 
The process is slow but not enough to let one observe how the ice cubes reduce their size. 
With a sip of water is possible to appreciate that the temperature of the water has decreased. 
After a while the ice cubes ``disappear'' and the glass water reaches an homogeneous mixture in an apparently equilibrium. 
Nevertheless, if we let the glass on a desk, the water will begin to evaporate slowly because the equilibration of the system is not a real equilibrium state. 
Moreover, over the years the glass will deteriorate. 
Further, the process will never reach an equilibrium state, but we may distinguish ``different levels'' of non-equilibrium. 
Focusing on the time we figure out that the process during the ice cubes are melting is not the same as the deterioration of the glass over the years.
The second one is much slower than the first one and allows we may say that it is at {\it quasi-equilibrium}. 

The above example shows that a system can be at a equilibrium state depending on the time scale of the observation. The degradation of the glass over the years is very slow in contrast with the melting of the ice cubes. Therefore, at the time scale of our observations we can found functions that evolve very slow; the may be considered as dynamic invariants that determine the equilibrium properties of the system. 

In this dissertation the notion of several ``equilibriums time scales'' is crucial because we take advantage of the partial equilibration of the system in the time scale of evolution of the CG variables. 
%Frase del libro de Pep
%The theory of non-equilibrium that we present is based on this notion of
%having several “equilibrium time scales” and takes advantage of the partial equilibration of
%the system in the time scale of evolution of the selected CG variables.
At the typical time scale of a given level of description, we will observe that the system reaches a quasi-equilibrium state in which the CG variables are dynamics invariants. 
The fast degrees of freedom rapidly reach the equilibrium while the CG variables evolve slowly. 
When quasi-equilibrium is valid, the CG variables which describe our system at this level of description evolve much slowly than the CG of the other more detailed level of description down in the hierarchy of level of descriptions. 
%Frase del libro de Pep
Therefore, the system is approximately described, in the appropriate time scale, with a generalized equilibrium ensemble, called the {\it relevant ensemble} or quasi-equilibrium ensemble, that takes into account the CG variables in its definition as if they were dynamical invariants of the system.

Quasi-equilibrium is connected with the notion of separation of time scales. 
As we said, the CG variables evolve slowly compared with the rest of degrees of freedom, which is, in fact, a necessary condition to obtain differential equations for the evolution of the CG variables. 
If there is not a well-separated time scales we may obtain dynamic equations but not simple at all, with complicated memory terms, as we will see in Chapter \ref{Chap:Theory}. 
This situation is referred to as a {\it non-Markovian} dynamics, to distinguish it from {\it Markovian} description in which the future state of the system is only determined by the present but not for the past of the system. 

\section{Molecular Dynamics simulations}
``We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.''
This sentence was written at the end of the 18th century by Pierre-Simon Laplace in its famous essay \textit{A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities} \cite{Laplace}.

The belief in the deterministic behaviour of the nature lasted for the next century until Charles-Eugène Delaunay and Henry Poincaré introduced the first notion of the effect of the initial conditions in the evolution of a system consisting on three or more bodies, the well-known three-body problem. 

Delaunay wrote two large books studied the three-body problem as a perturbated system in which the perturbation played the role of the third body. 
Years later, Poincaré thought about the stability of a three-body system introducing the first notion of chaos. 
He finally stated that there is not an equation that governs the motion of three or more bodies.

The N-body problem is crucial in real systems consisting on a huge number of particles. In the levels of description in which the particles of a system are interacting with the other, to solve the equations of motion is in the center of the problem. Let us suposse that we have a glass of water. 
%Párrafo inspirado tesis de Arturo
The number of water molecules is $N \sim 10^{24}$. Therefore, we need  $6N$ initial conditions and $6N$ equations of motion to be solved ($v_x,v_y,v_z$ and $x,y,x$ for every particle). Is obvious that is imposible to solve analytically this bunch of equations of motion.

Once we assume that we can not solve manually the equations of motion of the molecules of a glass of water, we may use a computer to solve them. 
The technique to obtain aproximated solutions of the time evolution equations of the molecules is called Molecular Dynamics (MD).
The idea behind this technique is to discretize the time in intervals called \textit{time steps} and to compute the position and velocity of every particle at every time step. If we estimate the number of colisions per second and calculate the number of evaluations we need to compute for every particle, we conclude that to solve the equations of motion of a real system, such a glass of water, is imposible even computationally \cite{TesisArturo}.
Therefore, only small or coarse systems (i.e. with a reasonable number of particles) can be addressed using MD simulations. 

The pioneering work of Adler and Wainwright \cite{Alder1957} in the fifties it was a first step in the development of the MD simulations when they studied the phase transition of a system consisting on hard sphares. In the sixties Gibson et al. \cite{Gibson1960} study the radiation damage using MD simulations and  Rahman \cite{Rahman1964} simulated a system consisting on 864 particles interacting with Lennard-Jones potential in order to study correlations in the motion of atoms in liquid argon.  

MD simulations play the role of the experiments in the real world. They provide us the observation which precedes the comprehension, because without comprehension science would be only documentation \cite{Rapaport}. Simulations allows, in contrast with the theory, assume less aproximations in exchange for a computational effort. Both simulations and physical theory must be coincide (i.e. the predictions of theory must coincide with the results of the simulations). If they differs is an indication of an error has been commited somewhere

This dissertation rests on two pillars. The first one consits on a theoretical derivation of the equations that governs the evolution of the CG variables of a fluid in contact with a solid. 
Along the derivation we only assume the markovian aproximation that simplify considerably the final equations, in which the transport coefficients are included through the Green-Kubo formula. 
The second pillar consists on MD simulations performed to measure the selected variables of the system which we need to validate the markovian aproximation and to compute the correlations included in the Green-Kubo formulae.
%The MD simulations we present in this dissertation are performed with the open source code LAMMPS \cite{Plimpton1995}, and the details of every simulation is included in the corresponding chapter.  


\section{Objetives reached in each publication}
This dissertation consist on six publications sorted by the chronological order of publications, which is, in fact, the logical order. 

The objetive in the first publication, {\it Nanoscale hydrodynamics near solids}, is to derive the hydrodynamic equations of a fluid in contact with a solid. 
In order to reach it, we derive Dynamic Density Functional Theory (DDFT) for a simple fluid including the density and the momentum density field.
We use the Kawasaki-Gunton operator technique to obtain the evolution equation of the average of that fields. The resulting equations contain transport coefficients in which there are transport kernels we must to compute. \Pendiente{Aquí introducir el problema del plateu} 

The second publication, {\it A solution to the plateau problem in the Green-Kubo formula}, adresses the plateau problem in order to obtain, though Mori theory, a corrected expression for the correlations without the plateau problem. The corrected Green-Kubo expression derived in this publication is crucial in this dissertation. All the results are based on the use of this expression without plateau problem. 

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth publications were published as a serial of discrete hydrodynamics.
The first publication of the serial, {\it Theory for planar flows with confinig walls}, is just the discretization of the resulting equations of the first paper. 
The objetive of this publication is to obtain the discrete equations in order to use them with MD simulations. 
\Pendiente{Introducir concepto de bin porque para el 6 lo necesito}

The second publication of the serial, {\it Space and time locality for unconfined fluids} is an important publication because we study the simplest system which is a fluid in periodic boundary conditions. 
In this paper we realize that in order to validate the markovian aproximation assumed in the derivation of the hydrodynamic equations we need to observe in the reciprocal space (i.e. Fourier spacefor unconfing). With this paper we understand the ``tools'' we need to move to a more complicated system such a confined fluid. 

In the third publication of the serial, {\it Non-Markovian behaviour near solids walls}, we study the non-markovian behaviour of a fluid near solids walls. We analyze the importance of the size of the bin if we want to observe markovian behaviour near the walls. 

Finally, in the last publication of this serial, titled {\it The slip boundary condition}, we
