@article{Huang2014,
abstract = {We have developed a Green-Kubo relation that enables accurate calculations of friction at solid-liquid interfaces directly from equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and that provides a pathway to bypass the time-scale limitations of typical nonequilibrium MD simulations. The theory has been validated for a number of different interfaces and it is demonstrated that the liquid-solid slip is an intrinsic property of an interface. Because of the high numerical efficiency of our method, it can be used in the design of interfaces for applications in aqueous environments, such as nano- and microfluidics.},

@article{Bocquet1994,
abstract = {Dynamical correlation functions of a fluid slab confined between two solid walls are computed using a phenomenologial, fluctuations to inhomogeneous molecular-dynamics systems. The phenomenological hydrodynamic appoach that generalizes Onsager's principle of linear regression of results are compared to exact simulations on simple model systems. This comparison permits a determination of the phenomenological parameters that describe the hydrodynamics of the fluid slab and especially of the boundary conditions {\{}BC's)that account for the presence of solid walls. In most cases, the hydrodynam- ic BC for the tangential velocity field is found to be a no-slip BC and must be applied in a plane that is separated from the solid by about one layer of fluid atoms. A set of formal relations between the param- eters that characterize the hydrodynamic BC and the equilibrium correlation functions of the inhomo- geneous fluid is also derived. These relations are analogous to the usual Green-Kubo equalities for the transport coefficients of bulk fluids.}},
