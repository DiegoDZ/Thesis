abstract = {The observed flow enhancement in highly confining geometries is believed to be caused by fluid velocity slip at the solid wall surface. Here we present a simple and highly accurate method to predict this slip using equilibrium molecular dynamics. Unlike previous equilibrium molecular dynamics methods, it allows us to directly compute the intrinsic wall-fluid friction coefficient rather than an empirical friction coefficient that includes all sources of friction for planar shear flow. The slip length predicted by our method is in excellent agreement with the slip length obtained from direct nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations.},

abstract = {In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations of a simple Lennard-Jones fluid confined in narrow slit pores and undergoing shear have been performed. The aim is to investigate the effects of density inhomogeneities at the fluid-solid interfaces on the shear viscosity profiles. It has been found that the local viscosity was varying strongly with the distance from the solid walls for both dilute and dense fluid states with oscillations correlated to the density ones. To describe the computed viscosity profiles, we propose a scheme that uses the local average density model, combinedwith an adequate weight function, for the configurational viscosity and a semiempirical model for the translational viscosity. It is shown that the proposed approach is able to provide viscosity profiles in good agreement with those coming from simulations for different pore widths and for different fluid states (dilute to dense)},

@article{Todd2008a,
abstract = {It has been suggested that for fluids in which the rate of strain varies appreciably over length scales of the order of the intermolecular interaction range, the viscosity must be treated as a nonlocal property of the fluid. The shear stress can then be postulated to be a convolution of this nonlocal viscosity kernel with the strain rate over all space. In this Letter, we confirm that this postulate is correct by a combination of analytical and numerical methods for an atomic fluid out of equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that a gradient expansion of the nonlocal constitutive equation gives a reasonable approximation to the shear stress in the small wave vector limit.},

abstract = {In this paper we present results for the wave-vector dependent shear viscosity for a model atomic fluid with short ranged repulsive interactions computed by molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that the data can be fitted to two different simple functional forms over a large density range, namely, a function composed of two Gaussian terms and a Lorentzian type function with a variable wave-vector exponent. The parameters of both functional forms are found to obey simple density dependencies. While the first functional form has the advantage that the inverse Fourier transform can be found analytically, the Lorentzian type function fits the wave-vector dependence better over the range of wave vectors and densities studied here. The results show that the real space viscosity kernel has a width of 2 to 3 atomic diameters. This means that the generalized hydrodynamic constitutive relation is required if the strain rate varies significantly over this distance, a situation commonly encountered for nanofluidic flows.},

abstract = {We report on molecular-dynamics simulations of Lennard-Jones liquids sheared between two solid walls. The velocity fields, flow boundary conditions, and fluid structure were studied for a variety of wall and fluid properties. A broad spectrum of boundary conditions was observed including slip, no-slip, and locking. We show that the degree of slip is directly related to the amount of structure induced in the fluid by the periodic potential from the solid walls. For weak wall-fluid interactions there is little ordering and slip was observed. At large interactions, substantial epitaxial ordering was induced and the first one or two fluid layers became locked to the wall. This epitaxial ordering was enhanced when the wall and fluid densities were equal. For unequal densities, highorder commensurate structures formed in the first fluid layer creating slip within the fluid.},

Phys. 121 10778, Zhang et al 2005 J. Chem. Phys. 122 219901). This model makes the assumption that, for pore widths significantly greater than the width of the viscosity kernel, one can approximate the true inhomogeneous kernel with a homogeneous kernel. We test this assumption with a simple mathematical model that mimics the simulation scheme of Zhang et al . Our analysis shows that the assumption of a homogeneous non-local viscosity kernel is reasonable for low density fluids confined to relatively large pore widths (channel separation distances) but becomes less reliable for higher density fluids and smaller channel separations. We find that the extraction of the viscosity kernel is not simple because of the lack of information about the stress response function at the fluid–wall boundaries. This lack of information can lead to singularities in the kernel and can also distort its shape. As a concluding remark, we also suggest a methodology which avoids these problems.},

This is typical of two of the most common types of flow: Couette and Poiseuille. For more complicated flow fields in which the streaming velocity involves higher order nonlinear terms, the use of nonlocal constitutive equations gives an exact description of the flow. These constitutive equations involve nonlocal transport kernels. For momentum transport we demonstrate that nonlocality will be significant for any particular flow field if the even moments of the nonlocal viscosity kernel are non-negligible. This corresponds to the condition that the strain rate varies appreciably over the width of the kernel in real space. Such conditions are likely to be dominant for nanofluidic flows.},

We present an alternative derivation of the relevant ensemble based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence from equilibrium. If the equilibrium ensemble is already known, then calculation of the relevant ensemble is considerably simplified. The constraints must be chosen with care in order to avoid contradictions between the two alternative derivations. The relative entropy functional measures how much a distribution departs from equilibrium. Therefore, it provides a distinct approach to the calculation of statistical ensembles that might be applicable to situations in which the formalism presented by Jaynes performs poorly (such as non-ergodic dynamical systems). {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The model is applied to a simple atomic fluid undergoing planar Poiseuille flow in a confined channel of several atomic diameters width. We compare the spatially dependent viscosity with a local generalization of Newton's law of viscosity and the Navier-Stokes viscosity, both of which are known to suffer extreme inaccuracies for highly inhomogeneous systems. The nonlocal constitutive model calculates effective position dependent viscosities that are free from the notorious singularities experienced by applying the commonly used local constitutive model. It is simple, general, and has widespread applicability in nanofluidics where experimental measurement of position dependent transport coefficients is currently inaccessible. In principle the method can be used to predict approximate flow profiles of any arbitrary inhomogeneous system. We demonstrate this by predicting the flow profile for a simple fluid undergoing planar Couette flow in a confined channel of several atomic diameters width.},

The application covers a wide range of topics: the theory of diffusion and heat conduction, fluid dynamics, relaxation phenomena, acoustical relaxation, and the behavior of systems in an electromagnetic field. The statistical foundations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are treated in detail, and there are special sections on fluctuation theory, the theory of stochastic processes, the kinetic theory of gases, and the derivation of the Onsager reciprocal relations. The implications of causality conditions and of dispersion relations are analyzed in depth. Advanced students will find a great number of challenging problems, with hints for their solutions. Chemists will be especially interested in the applications to electrochemistry and the theory of chemical reactions. Physicists, teachers, scholars, biologists, and anyone interested in the principle and modern applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics will find this classic monograph an invaluable reference.

abstract = {In this paper we present equilibrium molecular-dynamics results for the shear, rotational, and spin viscosities for fluids composed of linear molecules. The density dependence of the shear viscosity follows a stretched exponential function, whereas the rotational viscosity and the spin viscosities show approximately power-law dependencies. The frequency-dependent shear and spin viscosities are also studied. It is found that viscoelastic behavior is first manifested in the shear viscosity and that the real part of the spin viscosities features a maximum for nonzero frequency. The calculated transport coefficients are used together with the extended Navier-Stokes equations to investigate the effect of the coupling between the intrinsic angular momentum and linear momentum for highly confined fluids. Both steady and oscillatory flows are studied. It is shown, for example, that the fluid flow rate for Poiseuille flow is reduced by up to 10{\%} in a 2 nm channel for a buta-triene fluid at density 236 kg m(-3) and temperature 306 K. The coupling effect may, therefore, become very important for nanofluidic applications.},

Guided by the Theory of Coarse-Graining, we discuss the inclusion of thermal fluctuations in the non-linear diffusion equation. This sheds light on the meaning of such a fluctuating hydrodynamics equation and to the limitations of the approximations involved. The methodology proposed for the introduction of thermal fluctuations in finite element methods is general and valid for both regular and irregular grids in arbitrary dimensions. We focus here on simulations of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional using both regular and irregular 1D grids.

This is accomplished by a statistical mechanical derivation of an exact non-Markoffian kinetic equation for the probability distribution in the space of macroscopic state variables. The memory effect in the resulting transport equations is represented by a time convolution of the thermodynamic forces with memory functions. The latter are time-correlation functions in the rates of change of the phase functions corresponding to macroscopic quantities. The resulting transport equations are not restricted to small deviations from thermal equilibrium. Onsager's theory is shown to be the low-frequency limit of our causal theory.},

@article{Troian1997,
abstract = {Modelling fluid flows past a surface is a general problem in science and engineering, and requires some assumption about the nature of the fluid motion (the boundary condition) at the solid interface. One of the simplest boundary conditions is the no-slip condition, which dictates that a liquid element adjacent to the surface assumes the velocity of the surface. Although this condition has been remarkably successful in reproducing the characteristics of many types of flow, there exist situations in which it leads to singular or unrealistic behaviour—for example, the spreading of a liquid on a solid substrate, corner flow and the extrusion of polymer melts from a capillary tube. Numerous boundary conditions that allow for finite slip at the solid interface have been used to rectify these difficulties. But these phenomenological models fail to provide a universal picture of the momentum transport that occurs at liquid/solid interfaces. Here we present results from molecular dynamics simulations of newtonian liquids under shear which indicate that there exists a general nonlinear relationship between the amount of slip and the local shear rate at a solid surface. The boundary condition is controlled by the extent to which the liquid ‘feels' corrugations in the surface energy of the solid (owing in the present case to the atomic close-packing). Our generalized boundary condition allows us to relate the degree of slip to the underlying static properties and dynamic interactions of the walls and the fluid.},

The results of calculation are in good agreement with the Monte Carlo direct simulation results of K. Nanbu [Phys. Fluids 27, 2632 (1984)] and experimental data for all Knudsen numbers. The inclusion of normal stresses also brings about a new aspect to the flow properties which has not been seen before, since the flow profiles exhibit a phase-transition-like behavior as the Knudsen number increases beyond a critical value. There also appear slips in velocity at the inner cylinder wall in the supercritical regime of Knudsen number. At the critical Knudsen number the entropy production for the flow process also exhibits a singular behavior which is reminiscent of a second-order phase transition in thermodynamic systems. ? 1989 The American Physical Society.},

A set of formal relations between the param- eters that characterize the hydrodynamic BC and the equilibrium correlation functions of the inhomo- geneous fluid is also derived. These relations are analogous to the usual Green-Kubo equalities for the transport coefficients of bulk fluids.}},

abstract = {Equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were performed to better understand the hydrodynamic behavior ofwaterflowing through silicon nanochannels.Thewater-silicon interaction potentialwas calibrated by means of size-independent molecular dynamics simulations of silicon wettability. The wettability of silicon was found to be dependent on the strength of the water-silicon interaction and the structure of the underlying surface. As a result, the anisotropywas found to be an important factor in the wettability of these types of crystalline solids. Using this premise as a fundamental starting point, the hydrodynamic slip in nanoconfined water was characterized using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium calculations of the slip length under low shear rate operating conditions. As was the case for the wettability analysis, the hydrodynamic slip was found to be dependent on the wetted solid surface atomic structure. Additionally, the interfacial water liquid structure was the most significant parameter to describe the hydrodynamic boundary condition. The calibration of the water-silicon interaction potential performed by matching the experimental contact angle of silicon led to the verification of the no-slip condition, experimentally reported for silicon nanochannels at low shear rates.},

abstract = {The calculation of the friction matrix in the coarse-grained (CG) description of an atomistic system is a crucial issue, in order to properly account for the dissipative effects inherent to any reduced representation of the atomistic dynamics. Within the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator approach to CG, there are several possibilities for the definition of the friction matrix, depending on the projector that is being used. In this paper, the connection of two of these projectors (Mori's and Zwanzig's) is discussed and the corresponding merits and limitations are analysed. Moreover, three different ways of computing the friction matrix in the Mori's framework are presented, along with a discussion of their mutual connections. By the example of CG centre of mass blob variables in the graphene lattice, it is shown that, even though the three approaches are equivalent from a theoretical viewpoint, they may differ considerably in terms of practical implementation for computer simulation purposes. In the given example, which is representative for atomic lattices, it turns out that a linear regression of the velocity–velocity correlation function, inspired by the Einstein–Helfand approach, is the least error-prone against disturbances from optical modes.},

abstract = {We derive a coarse-grained description of the dynamics of a nanoparticle immersed in an isothermal simple fluid by performing a systematic coarse graining of the underlying microscopic dynamics. As coarse-grained or relevant variables, we select the position of the nanoparticle and the total mass and momentum density field of the fluid, which are locally conserved slow variables because they are defined to include the contribution of the nanoparticle. The theory of coarse graining based on the Zwanzing projection operator leads us to a system of stochastic ordinary differential equations that are closed in the relevant variables. We demonstrate that our discrete coarse-grained equations are consistent with a Petrov-Galerkin finite-element discretization of a system of formal stochastic partial differential equations which resemble previously used phenomenological models based on fluctuating hydrodynamics. Key to this connection between our “bottom-up” and previous “top-down” approaches is the use of the same dual orthogonal set of linear basis functions familiar from finite element methods (FEMs), both as a way to coarse-grain the microscopic degrees of freedom and as a way to discretize the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics. Another key ingredient is the use of a “linear for spiky” weak approximation which replaces microscopic “fields” with a linear FE interpolant inside expectation values. For the irreversible or dissipative dynamics, we approximate the constrained Green-Kubo expressions for the dissipation coefficients with their equilibrium averages. Under suitable approximations, we obtain closed approximations of the coarse-grained dynamics in a manner which gives them a clear physical interpretation and provides explicit microscopic expressions for all of the coefficients appearing in the closure. Our work leads to a model for dilute nanocolloidal suspensions that can be simulated effectively using feasibly short molecular dynamics simulations as input to a FEM fluctuating hydrodynamic solver.},

abstract = {A one-parameter model constitutive transport equation for the viscosity of the Lennard-Jones (L-J) fluid that is accurate for all equilibrium states of liquid and gas is proposed:The form of this equation is based upon the soft-sphere scaling laws for the residual density-dependent viscosity discovered originally by Ashurst and Hoover and uses their empirical coefficient (CAH). Enskog's density-independent limit theoretical term (eta0) is included to reproduce the viscosity in the limit of zero density accurately. Remaining discrepancies at low temperatures, for both gas and liquid densities, are largely removed when the linear-density Rainwater-Friend coefficient is added. The equation is comparable in accuracy to the 24-parameter empirical equation of state proposed by Rowley and Painter. Comparison with this correlation and previous MD results reveals a discrepancy near the triple point. To test the equation, new MD data for three fluid states are reported. Here, the viscosity is computed from time correlation functions resolved into the single-particle auto- and cross-correlation terms. It is found that, at high density (rho* {\textgreater} 0.8), the cross-correlations extend beyond 7sigma (molecule diameters) and oscillate in sign. This explains the wide scatter of previous MD viscosities for small L-J systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2006},

The microscopic derivation provides a set of discrete equations that exactly conserves mass, momentum, and energy and the dissipative part of the dynamics produces strict entropy increase. In addition, the microscopic derivation provides a practical implementation of thermal fluctuations in a way that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is satisfied exactly.

He discusses the three pillars of modern physics (quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and the theories of relativity), in addition to more cutting-edge themes such as econophysics, quantum gravity, quantum computers, and gauge theories. The book's approach is based on the idea that philosophy of physics is a kind of ‘interpretation game' in which we try to map physical theories onto our world. But the rules of this game often lead to a multiplicity of possible victors: rarely do we encounter a simple answer.

Interest centers on the nontrivial concentration dependence exhibited by these transport coefficients, which agrees well with that observed experimentally, and in relating this to the strength of the association between an ion and its first coordination shell. The relationships between the various transport coefficients, such as those between the diffusion coefficient and the viscosity (Stokes-Einstein) and the conductivity (Nernst-Einstein) also exhibit composition dependences that reflect this association. The connection between the internal mobility and two measures of the coordination shell dynamics (the cage relaxation time and the self-exchange velocity) is explored; it is shown that the self-exchange velocity follows the composition and temperature dependence of the internal mobility very well. Finally, it is shown that allowing for anion polarization in the interaction model increases the mobility of all species without changing the structure of the melt discernibly, with the largest effect being found for the Li(+) ion.},

Using direct nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (NEMD) we then calculate the slip length and slip velocity from the streaming velocity profiles in Poiseuille and Couette flows. The slip lengths and slip velocities from the NEMD simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with our EMD predictions. Our EMD method therefore enables one to directly calculate this intrinsic friction coefficient between fluid and solid and the slip length for a given fluid and solid, which is otherwise tedious to calculate using direct NEMD simulations at low pressure gradients or shear rates. The advantages of the EMD method over the NEMD method to calculate the slip lengths/flow rates for nanofluidic systems are discussed, and we finally examine the dynamic behaviour of slip due to an externally applied field and shear rate.},
