@article{Woodcock2006,
abstract = {A one-parameter model constitutive transport equation for the viscosity of the Lennard-Jones (L-J) fluid that is accurate for all equilibrium states of liquid and gas is proposed:The form of this equation is based upon the soft-sphere scaling laws for the residual density-dependent viscosity discovered originally by Ashurst and Hoover and uses their empirical coefficient (CAH). Enskog's density-independent limit theoretical term (eta0) is included to reproduce the viscosity in the limit of zero density accurately. Remaining discrepancies at low temperatures, for both gas and liquid densities, are largely removed when the linear-density Rainwater-Friend coefficient is added. The equation is comparable in accuracy to the 24-parameter empirical equation of state proposed by Rowley and Painter. Comparison with this correlation and previous MD results reveals a discrepancy near the triple point. To test the equation, new MD data for three fluid states are reported. Here, the viscosity is computed from time correlation functions resolved into the single-particle auto- and cross-correlation terms. It is found that, at high density (rho* {\textgreater} 0.8), the cross-correlations extend beyond 7sigma (molecule diameters) and oscillate in sign. This explains the wide scatter of previous MD viscosities for small L-J systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2006},

abstract = {The Adaptive Resolution Scheme (AdResS) is a hybrid scheme that allows one to treat a molecular system with different levels of resolution depending on the location of the molecules. The construction of a Hamiltonian based on the this idea (H-AdResS) allows one to formulate the usual tools of ensembles and statistical mechanics. We present a number of exact and approximate results that provide a statistical mechanics foundation for this simulation method. We also present simulation results that illustrate the theory.},

abstract = {The Green-Kubo formula for discrete hydrodynamic variables involves information about not only the fluid transport coefficients but also about discrete versions of the differential operators that govern the evolution of the discrete variables. This gives an intimate connection between discretization procedures in fluid dynamics and coarse-graining procedures used to obtain hydrodynamic behavior of molecular fluids. We observed that a natural definition of discrete hydrodynamic variables in terms of Voronoi cells leads to a Green-Kubo formula which is divergent, rendering the full coarse-graining strategy useless. In order to understand this subtle issue, in the present paper we consider the coarse graining of noninteracting Brownian particles. The discrete hydrodynamic variable for this problem is the number of particles within Voronoi cells. Thanks to the simplicity of the model we spot the origin of the singular behavior of the correlation functions. We offer an alternative definition, based on the concept of a Delaunay cell that behaves properly, suggesting the use of the Delaunay construction for the coarse graining of molecular fluids at the discrete hydrodynamic level.},

abstract = {Formally exact equations of motion satisfied by the gross variables of a macroscopic system valid far from thermal equilibrium are obtained with the aid of the new projection operator in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. These equations are used to study nonlinear shear viscosity and normal stress effects of a model incompressible fluid in the presence of a shear flow which is not necessarily small. We find that the mode-coupling mechanism responsible for the long-time tails in time-correlation functions becomes very important here also and that a simple power-series expansion in the rate of shear D therefore fails. The part of shear viscosity dependent upon the rate of shear and the normal stress effect are found to vary as |D|1/2 and |D|3/2, respectively.},

abstract = {The calculation of the friction matrix in the coarse-grained (CG) description of an atomistic system is a crucial issue, in order to properly account for the dissipative effects inherent to any reduced representation of the atomistic dynamics. Within the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator approach to CG, there are several possibilities for the definition of the friction matrix, depending on the projector that is being used. In this paper, the connection of two of these projectors (Mori's and Zwanzig's) is discussed and the corresponding merits and limitations are analysed. Moreover, three different ways of computing the friction matrix in the Mori's framework are presented, along with a discussion of their mutual connections. By the example of CG centre of mass blob variables in the graphene lattice, it is shown that, even though the three approaches are equivalent from a theoretical viewpoint, they may differ considerably in terms of practical implementation for computer simulation purposes. In the given example, which is representative for atomic lattices, it turns out that a linear regression of the velocity–velocity correlation function, inspired by the Einstein–Helfand approach, is the least error-prone against disturbances from optical modes.},

abstract = {The study of thermodynamics is especially timely today, as its concepts are being applied to problems in biology, biochemistry, electrochemistry, and engineering. This book treats irreversible processes and phenomena — non-equilibrium thermodynamics. S. R. de Groot and P. Mazur, Professors of Theoretical Physics, present a comprehensive and insightful survey of the foundations of the field, providing the only complete discussion of the fluctuating linear theory of irreversible thermodynamics. The application covers a wide range of topics: the theory of diffusion and heat conduction, fluid dynamics, relaxation phenomena, acoustical relaxation, and the behavior of systems in an electromagnetic field. The statistical foundations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are treated in detail, and there are special sections on fluctuation theory, the theory of stochastic processes, the kinetic theory of gases, and the derivation of the Onsager reciprocal relations. The implications of causality conditions and of dispersion relations are analyzed in depth. Advanced students will find a great number of challenging problems, with hints for their solutions. Chemists will be especially interested in the applications to electrochemistry and the theory of chemical reactions. Physicists, teachers, scholars, biologists, and anyone interested in the principle and modern applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics will find this classic monograph an invaluable reference.

Is there a ‘true' geometry of the universe? Why does there appear to be an arrow of time? Do humans play a special role in the world? In this unique introductory book, Dean Rickles guides the reader through these and other core questions that keep philosophers of physics up at night. He discusses the three pillars of modern physics (quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and the theories of relativity), in addition to more cutting-edge themes such as econophysics, quantum gravity, quantum computers, and gauge theories. The book's approach is based on the idea that philosophy of physics is a kind of ‘interpretation game' in which we try to map physical theories onto our world. But the rules of this game often lead to a multiplicity of possible victors: rarely do we encounter a simple answer. The Philosophy of Physics offers a highly accessible introduction to the latest developments in this exciting field. Written in a lively style, with many visual examples, it will appeal to beginner-level students in both physics and philosophy.},

abstract = {The maximum entropy formalism developed by Jaynes determines the relevant ensemble in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics by maximising the entropy functional subject to the constraints imposed by the available information. We present an alternative derivation of the relevant ensemble based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence from equilibrium. If the equilibrium ensemble is already known, then calculation of the relevant ensemble is considerably simplified. The constraints must be chosen with care in order to avoid contradictions between the two alternative derivations. The relative entropy functional measures how much a distribution departs from equilibrium. Therefore, it provides a distinct approach to the calculation of statistical ensembles that might be applicable to situations in which the formalism presented by Jaynes performs poorly (such as non-ergodic dynamical systems). {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},
