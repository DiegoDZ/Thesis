@book{Rickles2016,
abstract = {Does the future exist already? What is space? Are time machines physically possible? What is quantum mechanical reality like? Are there many universes? Is there a ‘true' geometry of the universe? Why does there appear to be an arrow of time? Do humans play a special role in the world? In this unique introductory book, Dean Rickles guides the reader through these and other core questions that keep philosophers of physics up at night. He discusses the three pillars of modern physics (quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and the theories of relativity), in addition to more cutting-edge themes such as econophysics, quantum gravity, quantum computers, and gauge theories. The book's approach is based on the idea that philosophy of physics is a kind of ‘interpretation game' in which we try to map physical theories onto our world. But the rules of this game often lead to a multiplicity of possible victors: rarely do we encounter a simple answer. The Philosophy of Physics offers a highly accessible introduction to the latest developments in this exciting field. Written in a lively style, with many visual examples, it will appeal to beginner-level students in both physics and philosophy.},

@article{Kawasaki1973a,
abstract = {Formally exact equations of motion satisfied by the gross variables of a macroscopic system valid far from thermal equilibrium are obtained with the aid of the new projection operator in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. These equations are used to study nonlinear shear viscosity and normal stress effects of a model incompressible fluid in the presence of a shear flow which is not necessarily small. We find that the mode-coupling mechanism responsible for the long-time tails in time-correlation functions becomes very important here also and that a simple power-series expansion in the rate of shear D therefore fails. The part of shear viscosity dependent upon the rate of shear and the normal stress effect are found to vary as |D|1/2 and |D|3/2, respectively.},

@book{Ottinger2005a,
abstract = {Beyond Equilibrium Thermodynamics fills a niche in the market by providing a comprehensive introduction to a new, emerging topic in the field. The importance of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is addressed in order to fully understand how a system works, whether it is in a biological system like the brain or a system that develops plastic. In order to fully grasp the subject, the book clearly explains the physical concepts and mathematics involved, as well as presenting problems and solutions; over 200 exercises and answers are included. Engineers, scientists, and applied mathematicians can all use the book to address their problems in modelling, calculating, and understanding dynamic responses of materials.},

@book{Tuckerman,
abstract = {Complex systems that bridge the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science can be studied at an unprecedented level of detail using increasingly sophisticated theoretical methodology and high-speed computers. The aim of this book is to prepare burgeoning users and developers to become active participants in this exciting and rapidly advancing research area by uniting for the first time, in one monograph, the basic concepts of equilibrium and time-dependent statistical mechanics with the modern techniques used to solve the complex problems that arise in real-world applications. The book contains a detailed review of classical and quantum mechanics, in-depth discussions of the most commonly used ensembles simultaneously with modern computational techniques such as molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo, and important topics including free-energy calculations, linear-response theory, harmonic baths and the generalized Langevin equation, critical phenomena, and advanced conformational sampling methods. Burgeoning users and developers are thus provided firm grounding to become active participants in this exciting and rapidly advancing research area, while experienced practitioners will find the book to be a useful reference tool for the field.},

@article{Melendez2014,
abstract = {The maximum entropy formalism developed by Jaynes determines the relevant ensemble in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics by maximising the entropy functional subject to the constraints imposed by the available information. We present an alternative derivation of the relevant ensemble based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence from equilibrium. If the equilibrium ensemble is already known, then calculation of the relevant ensemble is considerably simplified. The constraints must be chosen with care in order to avoid contradictions between the two alternative derivations. The relative entropy functional measures how much a distribution departs from equilibrium. Therefore, it provides a distinct approach to the calculation of statistical ensembles that might be applicable to situations in which the formalism presented by Jaynes performs poorly (such as non-ergodic dynamical systems). {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

@book{Groot1962,
abstract = {The study of thermodynamics is especially timely today, as its concepts are being applied to problems in biology, biochemistry, electrochemistry, and engineering. This book treats irreversible processes and phenomena — non-equilibrium thermodynamics. S. R. de Groot and P. Mazur, Professors of Theoretical Physics, present a comprehensive and insightful survey of the foundations of the field, providing the only complete discussion of the fluctuating linear theory of irreversible thermodynamics. The application covers a wide range of topics: the theory of diffusion and heat conduction, fluid dynamics, relaxation phenomena, acoustical relaxation, and the behavior of systems in an electromagnetic field. The statistical foundations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are treated in detail, and there are special sections on fluctuation theory, the theory of stochastic processes, the kinetic theory of gases, and the derivation of the Onsager reciprocal relations. The implications of causality conditions and of dispersion relations are analyzed in depth. Advanced students will find a great number of challenging problems, with hints for their solutions. Chemists will be especially interested in the applications to electrochemistry and the theory of chemical reactions. Physicists, teachers, scholars, biologists, and anyone interested in the principle and modern applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics will find this classic monograph an invaluable reference.
