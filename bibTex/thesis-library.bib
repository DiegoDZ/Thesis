abstract = {The maximum entropy formalism developed by Jaynes determines the relevant ensemble in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics by maximising the entropy functional subject to the constraints imposed by the available information. We present an alternative derivation of the relevant ensemble based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence from equilibrium. If the equilibrium ensemble is already known, then calculation of the relevant ensemble is considerably simplified. The constraints must be chosen with care in order to avoid contradictions between the two alternative derivations. The relative entropy functional measures how much a distribution departs from equilibrium. Therefore, it provides a distinct approach to the calculation of statistical ensembles that might be applicable to situations in which the formalism presented by Jaynes performs poorly (such as non-ergodic dynamical systems). {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

@article{Daivis2018,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The fluid dynamics of macroscopic and microscopic systems is well developed and has been extensively validated. Its extraordinary success makes it tempting to apply Navier–Stokes fluid dynamics without modification to systems of ever decreasing dimensions as studies of nanofluidics become more prevalent. However, this can result in serious error. In this paper, we discuss several ways in which nanoconfined fluid flow differs from macroscopic flow. We give particular attention to several topics that have recently received attention in the literature: slip, spin angular momentum coupling, nonlocal stress response and density inhomogeneity. In principle, all of these effects can now be accurately modelled using validated theories. Although the basic principles are now fairly well understood, much work remains to be done in their application.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We investigate the hydrodynamic boundary condition for simple nanofluidic systems such as argon and methane flowing in graphene nanochannels using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (EMD) in conjunction with our recently proposed method [J. S. Hansen, B. D. Todd, and P. J. Daivis, Phys. Rev. E 84, 016313 (2011)]. We first calculate the fluid-graphene interfacial friction coefficient, from which we can predict the slip length and the average velocity of the first fluid layer close to the wall (referred to as the slip velocity). Using direct nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (NEMD) we then calculate the slip length and slip velocity from the streaming velocity profiles in Poiseuille and Couette flows. The slip lengths and slip velocities from the NEMD simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with our EMD predictions. Our EMD method therefore enables one to directly calculate this intrinsic friction coefficient between fluid and solid and the slip length for a given fluid and solid, which is otherwise tedious to calculate using direct NEMD simulations at low pressure gradients or shear rates. The advantages of the EMD method over the NEMD method to calculate the slip lengths/flow rates for nanofluidic systems are discussed, and we finally examine the dynamic behaviour of slip due to an externally applied field and shear rate.},

abstract = {The dynamical properties of ionic melts formed from mixtures of LiCl and KCl have been studied across the full composition range in computer simulations of sufficient length to enable reliable values for such collective transport coefficients as the viscosity, conductivity, and internal mobilities to be determined reliably. Interest centers on the nontrivial concentration dependence exhibited by these transport coefficients, which agrees well with that observed experimentally, and in relating this to the strength of the association between an ion and its first coordination shell. The relationships between the various transport coefficients, such as those between the diffusion coefficient and the viscosity (Stokes-Einstein) and the conductivity (Nernst-Einstein) also exhibit composition dependences that reflect this association. The connection between the internal mobility and two measures of the coordination shell dynamics (the cage relaxation time and the self-exchange velocity) is explored; it is shown that the self-exchange velocity follows the composition and temperature dependence of the internal mobility very well. Finally, it is shown that allowing for anion polarization in the interaction model increases the mobility of all species without changing the structure of the melt discernibly, with the largest effect being found for the Li(+) ion.},

abstract = {The growing interest in energy applications of molten salts is justified by several of their properties. Their possibilities of usage as a coolant, heat transfer fluid or heat storage substrate, require thermo-hydrodynamic refined calculations. Many researchers are using simulation techniques, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their projects or conceptual designs. The aim of this work is providing a review of basic properties (density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and heat capacity) of the most common and referred salt mixtures. After checking data, tabulated and graphical outputs are given in order to offer the most suitable available values to be used as input parameters for other calculations or simulations. The reviewed values show a general scattering in characterization, mainly in thermal properties. This disagreement suggests that, in several cases, new studies must be started (and even new measurement techniques should be developed) to obtain accurate values. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The dynamic properties of interfaces often play a crucial role in the macroscopic dynamics of multiphase soft condensed matter systems. These properties affect the dynamics of emulsions, of dispersions of vesicles, of biological fluids, of coatings, of free surface flows, of immiscible polymer blends, and of many other complex systems. The study of interfacial dynamic properties, surface rheology, is therefore a relevant discipline for many branches of physics, chemistry, engineering, and life sciences. In the past three to four decades a vast amount of literature has been produced dealing with the rheological properties of interfaces stabilized by low molecular weight surfactants, proteins, (bio)polymers, lipids, colloidal particles, and various mixtures of these surface active components. In this paper recent experiments are reviewed in the field of surface rheology, with particular emphasis on the models used to analyze surface rheological data. Most of the models currently used are straightforward generalizations of models developed for the analysis of rheological data of bulk phases. In general the limits on the validity of these generalizations are not discussed. Not much use is being made of recent advances in nonequilibrium thermodynamic formalisms for multiphase systems, to construct admissible models for the stress-deformation behavior of interfaces. These formalisms are ideally suited to construct thermodynamically admissible constitutive equations for rheological behavior that include the often relevant couplings to other fluxes in the interface (heat and mass), and couplings to the transfer of mass from the bulk phase to the interface. In this review recent advances in the application of classical irreversible thermodynamics, extended irreversible thermodynamics, rational thermodynamics, extended ra- tional thermodynamics, and the general equation for the nonequilibrium reversible-irreversible coupling formalism to multiphase systems are also discussed, and shown how these formalisms can be used to generate a wide range of thermodynamically admissible constitutive models for the surface stress tensor. Some of the generalizations currently in use are shown to have only limited validity. The aim of this review is to stimulate new developments in the fields of experimental surface rheology and constitutive modeling of multiphase systems using nonequilibrium thermody- namic formalisms and to promote a closer integration of these disciplines},

At a detailed level of description, the system is governed by a Brownian dynamics of non-interacting particles. The coarse-level is described by discrete concentration variables defined in terms of Delaunay cells. These coarse variables obey a stochastic differential equation that can be understood as a discrete version of a diffusion equation. We study different models for the two basic building blocks of this equation which are the free energy function and the diffusion matrix. The free energy function is shown to be non-additive due to the overlapping of cells in the Delaunay construction. The diffusion matrix is state dependent in principle, but for near-equilibrium situations it is shown that it may be safely evaluated at the equilibrium value of the concentration field.},

The statistical foundations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are treated in detail, and there are special sections on fluctuation theory, the theory of stochastic processes, the kinetic theory of gases, and the derivation of the Onsager reciprocal relations. The implications of causality conditions and of dispersion relations are analyzed in depth. Advanced students will find a great number of challenging problems, with hints for their solutions.

abstract = {The dependence of velocity slip at a liquid-solid interface upon the character of the solid is studied using atomistic simulation methods for Lennard-Jones model systems. The effect of the thermostatting mechanisms, often used in such simulations, is also investigated. The solid atom vibrational frequency is shown not to have a significant effect on the slip length for the range of parameters investigated; however, it is found that application of a thermostat to the fluid changes the slip length at low shear rates and results in an unphysical divergent slip behavior at high shear rates. On the other hand, removing the generated heat through the walls, which is more analogous to a laboratory condition, results in a nonlinearly decreasing slip length with shear rate that asymptotes to the no-slip limit at high shear rates. This effect is due to viscous heating, which increases the fluid temperature and pressure. A nonlinear relationship between the slip length and the shear rate collapses the shear-rate-slip-length dependence onto a single curve for a range of cases when heat is more realistically removed through the walls.},

abstract = {The Green-Kubo formula for discrete hydrodynamic variables involves information about not only the fluid transport coefficients but also about discrete versions of the differential operators that govern the evolution of the discrete variables. This gives an intimate connection between discretization procedures in fluid dynamics and coarse-graining procedures used to obtain hydrodynamic behavior of molecular fluids. We observed that a natural definition of discrete hydrodynamic variables in terms of Voronoi cells leads to a Green-Kubo formula which is divergent, rendering the full coarse-graining strategy useless. In order to understand this subtle issue, in the present paper we consider the coarse graining of noninteracting Brownian particles. The discrete hydrodynamic variable for this problem is the number of particles within Voronoi cells. Thanks to the simplicity of the model we spot the origin of the singular behavior of the correlation functions. We offer an alternative definition, based on the concept of a Delaunay cell that behaves properly, suggesting the use of the Delaunay construction for the coarse graining of molecular fluids at the discrete hydrodynamic level.},

abstract = {A critical investigation is presented in this work to study the effect of nanoparticle addition, temperature, and nanoparticle size-dependence on the specific heat capacity of both conventional and molten salt-based nanofluids. The effects of temperature and nanoparticle volume fraction on the specific heat capacity of conventional nanofluids are in agreement in all studies cited in this review. Different correlations based on the available data were developed as a function of temperature and volume concentration only. However, the effect of nanoparticle size-dependence was ignored in these correlations. A general correlation for Al2O3-water nanofluids, one of the most commonly studied nanofluids, that takes into account the effect of temperature, volume fraction, and nanoparticle size-dependence was developed and verified in this review. Disagreement was reported for the results of the specific heat capacity of molten salt-based nanofluids. A number of studies showed an enhancement in the specific heat capacity of nanofluids using 1{\%} concentration of nanoparticles by weight only. However, other studies have shown deterioration in the specific heat capacity of nanofluids compared with the base mixture using various volume concentrations of nanoparticles. Moreover, very few studies have demonstrated the effect of nanoparticle size-dependence on the specific heat capacity of molten salt nanofluids and disagreement in the results was reported in these studies. Few models based on the conventional specific heat model were developed to determine the specific heat capacity of molten salt nanofluids. These models suffer from the lack of knowledge of many terms in these equations which make them impractical. Different mechanisms were assumed in the literature to explain the abnormal behavior of molten salt nanofluids. Additional theoretical and experimental research studies are required to clarify the mechanisms responsible for specific heat capacity enhancement or deterioration in nanofluids.},

We show that the degree of slip is directly related to the amount of structure induced in the fluid by the periodic potential from the solid walls. For weak wall-fluid interactions there is little ordering and slip was observed. At large interactions, substantial epitaxial ordering was induced and the first one or two fluid layers became locked to the wall. This epitaxial ordering was enhanced when the wall and fluid densities were equal. For unequal densities, highorder commensurate structures formed in the first fluid layer creating slip within the fluid.},

However, as the flow passage is shrunk down to the nanometer size, the micro-interaction between the fluid and the confined solid walls becomes significant, and the conventional hydrodynamic model will become insufficient for describing such a flow system. In this work, we propose a generalized hydrodynamic model that is derived from a recently developed kinetic model for strong inhomogeneous fluid systems [Guo, Zhao, and Shi, Phys. Rev. E 71, 035301(R) (2005)]. We show that the present model can reduce to other hydrodynamic models in certain limits, and can be used for flows ranging from nanoscale to macroscale. Based on this generalized model, the static and dynamic behaviors of several simple fluid systems are studied. It is shown that at a small scale, the results predicted by the generalized hydrodynamic model are in agreement with those simulated by the molecular dynamic and the Monte Carlo methods, while for flow systems at a large scale, the results agree with those by the Navier-Stokes equations. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

This model makes the assumption that, for pore widths significantly greater than the width of the viscosity kernel, one can approximate the true inhomogeneous kernel with a homogeneous kernel. We test this assumption with a simple mathematical model that mimics the simulation scheme of Zhang et al . Our analysis shows that the assumption of a homogeneous non-local viscosity kernel is reasonable for low density fluids confined to relatively large pore widths (channel separation distances) but becomes less reliable for higher density fluids and smaller channel separations. We find that the extraction of the viscosity kernel is not simple because of the lack of information about the stress response function at the fluid–wall boundaries. This lack of information can lead to singularities in the kernel and can also distort its shape. As a concluding remark, we also suggest a methodology which avoids these problems.},

Enskog's density-independent limit theoretical term (eta0) is included to reproduce the viscosity in the limit of zero density accurately. Remaining discrepancies at low temperatures, for both gas and liquid densities, are largely removed when the linear-density Rainwater-Friend coefficient is added. The equation is comparable in accuracy to the 24-parameter empirical equation of state proposed by Rowley and Painter. Comparison with this correlation and previous MD results reveals a discrepancy near the triple point. To test the equation, new MD data for three fluid states are reported. Here, the viscosity is computed from time correlation functions resolved into the single-particle auto- and cross-correlation terms. It is found that, at high density (rho* {\textgreater} 0.8), the cross-correlations extend beyond 7sigma (molecule diameters) and oscillate in sign. This explains the wide scatter of previous MD viscosities for small L-J systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2006},

The thermal properties of the nanofluids obtained were investigated. These nanofluids can be used in concentrating solar plants with a reduction of storage material if an improvement in the specific heat is achieved. The base salt mixture was a NaNO3-KNO3 (60:40 ratio) binary salt. The nanoparticles used were silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), titania (TiO2), and a mix of silica-alumina (SiO2-Al2O3). Three weight fractions were evaluated: 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt.{\%}. Each nanofluid was prepared in water solution, sonicated, and evaporated. Measurements on thermophysical properties were performed by differential scanning calorimetry analysis and the dispersion of the nanoparticles was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results obtained show that the addition of 1.0 wt.{\%} of nanoparticles to the base salt increases the specific heat of 15{\%} to 57{\%} in the solid phase and of 1{\%} to 22{\%} in the liquid phase. In particular, this research shows that the addition of silica-alumina nanoparticles has a significant potential for enhancing the thermal storage characteristics of the NaNO3-KNO3 binary salt. These results deviated from the predictions of the theoretical model used. SEM suggests a greater interaction between these nanoparticles and the salt.},

abstract = {A new generalization of Onsager's theory of irreversible processes is presented. The main purpose is to allow for memory effects or causal time behavior, so that the response to a thermodynamic force comes later than the application of the force. This is accomplished by a statistical mechanical derivation of an exact non-Markoffian kinetic equation for the probability distribution in the space of macroscopic state variables. The memory effect in the resulting transport equations is represented by a time convolution of the thermodynamic forces with memory functions. The latter are time-correlation functions in the rates of change of the phase functions corresponding to macroscopic quantities. The resulting transport equations are not restricted to small deviations from thermal equilibrium. Onsager's theory is shown to be the low-frequency limit of our causal theory.},

Nanofluid can be used for energy savings by increasing the heat transfer performance of the heat recovery systems, which are generally struggling to overcome the present challenging issues such as global warming, greenhouse effect, climate change, and fuel crisis. Specific heat capacity is necessary to analyze energy and exergy performances. This paper extant different characteristic of specific heat capacity of nanofluids containing preparation and measuring methods, effects of volume fraction, temperature, types and sizes of nanoparticles and base fluids. Additionally a compilation has been done on available theoretical correlation related to specific heat of nanofluid. Based on existing experimental and theoretical results, nanofluid specific heat falls with the enhancement of volume concentration of nanoparticle though there are some inconsistencies among outcomes. Moreover, specific heat of the nanofluids are generally increased after adding dispersant in the mixtures. However, many contradictory results about the effects of temperatures on specific heat of nanofluids found in the literatures. Therefore, this review will help the researchers and related peoples to get enough information to select a nanofluid based on specific heat for their practical applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We propose the derivation and calculation of the hydrodynamic slip length from the first principles of statistical mechanics, based on a combination of linear response theory and equilibrium molecular theory of solvation. The slip length obtained is independent of the type of flow and is related to the fluid organisation near the solid surface, as governed by the solid–liquid and liquid–liquid interactions. In a wide range of shear rates and surface–liquid interactions, the slip length is expressed in terms of the Green–Kubo–Nakano relations as a function of the anisotropic inhomogeneous time correlation function of density fluctuations of the liquid in contact with the surface. The presented treatment generalises the phenomenological definition of the friction coefficient and the slip length to a tensor quantity, which reflects an anisotropic nature of an ordered crystalline surface. We derive generic analytical expressions for the liquid–surface friction coefficient and slip length for an arbitrary surface–liquid interaction potential. We further illustrate it by numerical calculations for the case of a laminar flow of several molecular liquids and water, at ambient conditions in contact with the (100) FCC surface of gold, copper and nickel modelled using all-atom or united-atom models for liquids and the Steele potential for crystalline surfaces. The values obtained for slip length range from few to hundreds of nanometres and are consistent with experimental measurements. We also calculate pressure and temperature dependence on the slip length for water in a wide range of these thermodynamic parameters. The information obtained is intended to be used, in particular, to control or manipulate the flow in electrokinetic processes.},

The discretized equation preserves the structure of the continuum equation. Specifically, it conserves the total number of particles and fulfills an H-theorem as the original partial differential equation. Guided by the Theory of Coarse-Graining, we discuss the inclusion of thermal fluctuations in the non-linear diffusion equation. This sheds light on the meaning of such a fluctuating hydrodynamics equation and to the limitations of the approximations involved. The methodology proposed for the introduction of thermal fluctuations in finite element methods is general and valid for both regular and irregular grids in arbitrary dimensions. We focus here on simulations of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional using both regular and irregular 1D grids. Convergence of the numerical results is obtained for the static and dynamic structure factors as the resolution of the grid is increased.},

Researches so far suggest that nanofluids offer excellent heat transfer enhancement over conventional base fluids. The enhancement depends on several factors such as particle shape, particle size distribution, volume fraction of nanoparticles, temperature, pH, and thermal conductivities of nanoparticles and base fluids. This paper presents an updated review on nanofluids with the emphasis on heat transfer enhancement including formulation, physical properties, biological and non-biological applications, stability, possible mechanisms for the enhancement of heat conduction, and numerical modelling of nanofluids. Based on the research findings, a number of challenges are emphasized in order to understand the underlying physics for future industrial take-up of the nanofluids technology. Further computational studies are also required in order to understand all of the factors affecting on the enhancement of thermal conductivity of nanaofluids},

abstract = {In this paper we present results for the wave-vector dependent shear viscosity for a model atomic fluid with short ranged repulsive interactions computed by molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that the data can be fitted to two different simple functional forms over a large density range, namely, a function composed of two Gaussian terms and a Lorentzian type function with a variable wave-vector exponent. The parameters of both functional forms are found to obey simple density dependencies. While the first functional form has the advantage that the inverse Fourier transform can be found analytically, the Lorentzian type function fits the wave-vector dependence better over the range of wave vectors and densities studied here. The results show that the real space viscosity kernel has a width of 2 to 3 atomic diameters. This means that the generalized hydrodynamic constitutive relation is required if the strain rate varies significantly over this distance, a situation commonly encountered for nanofluidic flows.},

It has been found that the local viscosity was varying strongly with the distance from the solid walls for both dilute and dense fluid states with oscillations correlated to the density ones. To describe the computed viscosity profiles, we propose a scheme that uses the local average density model, combinedwith an adequate weight function, for the configurational viscosity and a semiempirical model for the translational viscosity.

The condition that the effect of the surface layer on the bulk hydrodynamics must be independent of its thickness h is shown to imply a set of consistent 'scaling relationships' between h and the surface-layer variables/ parameters. The use of the scaling relations, in conjunction with the surface-layer equations of motion derived from the Onsager principle, directly leads to the hydrodynamic boundary conditions. We demonstrate the surface-layer scaling process both physically and mathematically, and relate the parameters of the boundary conditions to those in the surface-layer equations of motion. In spatial regions outside the surface layer, equivalence between the use of surface-layer dynamics and boundary conditions is numerically demonstrated for Couette flows. As an application of the present approach, we derive the liquid-crystal hydrodynamic boundary conditions in which the rotational and translational dynamics are coupled. {\textcopyright} 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {We present results from nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of simple fluids undergoing planar Poiseuille flow in a slit pore only a few molecular diameters in width. The calculations reported in this publication build on previous results by including the effects of attractive forces and studying the flow at narrower pore widths. Our aims are: (1) to examine the role of attractive forces in determining hydrodynamic properties, (2) to provide clearer evidence for the existence of a non-Markovian generalization of Newtons law, (3) to examine the slip-stick boundary conditions in more detail by using a high spatial resolution of the streaming velocity profiles, (4) to investigate the significance of the recently proposed cross-coupling coefficient on the temperature profiles. The presence of attractive interactions gives rise to interesting packing effects, but otherwise, does not significantly alter the spatial dependence of hydrodynamic quantities. We find the strongest evidence to date that Newtons Law breaks down for very narrow pores; the shear viscosity exhibits singularities. We suggest a method to test the validity of the non-Markovian generalization of Newtons Law. No-slip boundary conditions are found to apply, even at these microscopic length scales, provided one takes into account the finite size of the wall atoms. The effects of any strain rate induced coupling to the heat flow are found to be insignificant.},

@article{Kobryn2008,
abstract = {Motivated by the fundamental questions raised by the most recent experimental achievements in nanofluidics, we propose the first-ever derivation and calculation of the hydrodynamic slip length from the first principles of statistical mechanics, namely, a combination of linear response theory and equilibrium molecular theory of solvation. The slip length derived is related to the fluid organization near the solid surface, as governed by the solid-liquid interaction. In the wide range of shear rates and surface-liquid interactions, the slip length is expressed in terms of the Green-Kubo-Nakano relations as a function of the anisotropic inhomogeneous time-correlation function of density fluctuations of the liquid in contact with the surface. The time dependence of the correlation function is factored out by treating it in the hydrodynamic limit. The spatially inhomogeneous two-body correlation function is represented in the Kirkwood-type approximation as a product of the three-dimensional density distributions of interaction sites of the liquid near the surface and the site-site pair correlations of the bulk liquid. The presented treatment generalizes the phenomenological definition of the friction coefficient (as well as the slip length) to a tensor quantity, which reflects an anisotropic nature of an ordered crystalline or nanopatterned surface. This enables theoretical prediction of friction forces acting aslant to the liquid flow direction for such surfaces. We derive generic analytical expressions for the liquid-surface friction coefficient (and slip length) for an arbitrary surface-liquid interaction potential. We further illustrate it by numerical calculations for a laminar flow of nine different molecular liquids, including water, at ambient conditions in contact with the (100) face-centered cubic cell surface of gold, copper, and nickel modeled by using optimized potential for liquid simulation models for liquids and the Steele potential for crystalline surfaces. The obtained values for slip length range from few to hundreds of nanometers and microns and are consistent with experimental measurements.},

We find that the mode-coupling mechanism responsible for the long-time tails in time-correlation functions becomes very important here also and that a simple power-series expansion in the rate of shear D therefore fails.

In other words, why 'nanofluidics' deserves its own brand name ? In this critical review, we will explore the vast manifold of length scales emerging for the fluid behavior at the nanoscales, as well as the associated mechanisms and corresponding applications. We will in particular explore the interplay between bulk and interface phenomena. The limit of validity of the continuum approaches will be discussed, as well as the numerous surface induced effects occuring at these scales, from hydrodynamic slippage to the various electro-kinetic phenomena originating from the couplings between hydrodynamics and electrostatics.

abstract = {Nanotechnology provides a flexible platform for the development of effective therapeutic nanomaterials that can interact specifically with a target in a biological system and provoke a desired response. Of the nanomaterials studied, iron oxide nanoparticles have emerged as one of top candidates for cancer therapy. Their intrinsic superparamagnetism enables noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and their biodegradability is advantageous for in vivo applications. A therapeutic superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) typically consists of three primary components: an iron oxide nanoparticle core that serves as both a carrier for therapeutics and contrast agent for MRI, a coating on the iron oxide nanoparticle that promotes favorable interactions between the SPION and the biological system, and a therapeutic payload that performs the designated function in vivo. Often, the design may include a targeting ligand that recognizes the receptors over-expressed on the exterior surface of cancer cells.The body is a highly complex system that imposes multiple physiological and cellular barriers to foreign objects. Thus, the success of a therapeutic SPION largely relies on the design of the iron oxide core to ensure its detection in MRI and the coatings that allow the nanoparticles to bypass these barriers. Strategies to bypass the physiological barriers, such as liver, kidneys, and spleen, involve tuning the overall size and surface chemistry of the SPION to maximize blood half-life and facilitate the navigation in the body. Strategies to bypass cellular barriers include the use of targeting agents to maximize uptake of the SPION by cancer cells and the employment of materials that promote desired intracellular trafficking and enable controlled drug release.The payload can be genes, proteins, chemotherapy drugs, or a combination of these molecules. Each type of therapeutic molecule requires a specific coating design to maximize the loading and to achieve effective delivery and release. In this Account, we discuss the primary design parameters in developing therapeutic SPIONs with a focus on surface coating design to overcome the barriers imposed by the body's defense system. We provide examples of how these design parameters have been implemented to produce SPIONs for specific therapeutic applications.Although there are still challenges to be addressed, SPIONs show great promise in the successful diagnosis and treatment of the most devastating cancers. Once the critical design parameters have been optimized, these nanoparticles, combined with imaging modalities, can serve as truly multifunctional theranostic agents that not only perform a therapeutic function but also provide instant clinical feedback, allowing the physician to adjust the treatment plan. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

He discusses the three pillars of modern physics (quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and the theories of relativity), in addition to more cutting-edge themes such as econophysics, quantum gravity, quantum computers, and gauge theories. The book's approach is based on the idea that philosophy of physics is a kind of ‘interpretation game' in which we try to map physical theories onto our world. But the rules of this game often lead to a multiplicity of possible victors: rarely do we encounter a simple answer. The Philosophy of Physics offers a highly accessible introduction to the latest developments in this exciting field. Written in a lively style, with many visual examples, it will appeal to beginner-level students in both physics and philosophy.},

We report a generalization of DFT to treat the non-equilibrium dynamics of classical many-body systems subject to Brownian dynamics. Our approach is based upon a dynamical functional consisting of reversible free energy changes and irreversible power dissipation. Minimization of this “free power” functional with respect to the microscopic one-body current yields a closed equation of motion. In the equilibrium limit the theory recovers the standard variational principle of DFT. The adiabatic dynamical density functional theory is obtained when approximating the power dissipation functional by that of an ideal gas. Approximations to the excess (over ideal) power dissipation yield numerically tractable equations of motion beyond the adiabatic approximation, opening the door to the systematic study of systems far from equilibrium.},

This is typical of two of the most common types of flow: Couette and Poiseuille. For more complicated flow fields in which the streaming velocity involves higher order nonlinear terms, the use of nonlocal constitutive equations gives an exact description of the flow. These constitutive equations involve nonlocal transport kernels. For momentum transport we demonstrate that nonlocality will be significant for any particular flow field if the even moments of the nonlocal viscosity kernel are non-negligible. This corresponds to the condition that the strain rate varies appreciably over the width of the kernel in real space. Such conditions are likely to be dominant for nanofluidic flows.},

Neutron activation analysis was used to measure the actual mass fraction of the alumina nanoparticles in the nanofluids. The nominal mass fraction was always larger than the actual mass fraction, with differences up to 41{\%}. The specific heat was measured using a modulated differential scanning calorimeter (MDSC). The results showed that there exists a parabolic relation between specific heat and mass fraction of alumina nanoparticles (maximum 30.6{\%} enhancement at 0.78{\%} actual mass fraction of alumina nanoparticles). The measurement uncertainty for the specific heat values was less than 4{\%}.

abstract = {In this paper we present equilibrium molecular-dynamics results for the shear, rotational, and spin viscosities for fluids composed of linear molecules. The density dependence of the shear viscosity follows a stretched exponential function, whereas the rotational viscosity and the spin viscosities show approximately power-law dependencies. The frequency-dependent shear and spin viscosities are also studied. It is found that viscoelastic behavior is first manifested in the shear viscosity and that the real part of the spin viscosities features a maximum for nonzero frequency. The calculated transport coefficients are used together with the extended Navier-Stokes equations to investigate the effect of the coupling between the intrinsic angular momentum and linear momentum for highly confined fluids. Both steady and oscillatory flows are studied. It is shown, for example, that the fluid flow rate for Poiseuille flow is reduced by up to 10{\%} in a 2 nm channel for a buta-triene fluid at density 236 kg m(-3) and temperature 306 K. The coupling effect may, therefore, become very important for nanofluidic applications.},

The value of this friction coefficient is computed using a novel generalized Langevin equation formulation that eliminates the use of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation. Gravity driven flows of SPC/E water confined between graphene and silicon slit shaped nanochannels are considered as examples for low and high friction cases.

An effect of structural relaxation and other nonhydrodynamic relaxation processes on the dispersion law is discussed. A simple analytical expression for the dispersion law in the long-wavelength region of acoustic excitations is obtained within a three-variable viscoelastic model of generalized hydrodynamics. It is shown that the deviation from the linear dependence in the long-wavelength region can be either "positive" or "negative" depending on the ratio between the high-frequency (elastic) and isothermal speed of sound. An effect of thermal fluctuations on positive and negative dispersion is estimated from the analytical solution of a five-variable thermoviscoelastic model that generalizes the results of the viscoelastic treatment.

abstract = {Near a fluid-solid interface, the fluid spatial density profile is highly nonuniform at the molecular scale. This nonuniformity can have profound effects on the dynamical behavior of the fluid and has been shown to play an especially important role when modeling a wide variety of nanoscale heat and momentum transfer phenomena. We use molecular-mechanics arguments and molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to develop a better understanding of the structure of the first fluid layer directly adjacent to the solid in the layering regime, as delineated by a nondimensional number that compares the effects of wall-fluid interaction to thermal energy. Using asymptotic analysis of the Nernst-Planck equation, we show that features of the fluid density profile close to the wall, such as the areal density of the first layer FL (defined as the number of atoms in this layer per unit of fluid-solid interfacial area), can be expressed as polynomial functions of the fluid average density $\rho$ ave . This is found to be in agreement with MD simulations, which also show that the width of the first layer h FL is a linear function of the average density and only a weak function of the temperature T . These results can be combined to show that, for system average densities corresponding to a dense fluid ($\rho$ ave 0.7), the ratio C ≡ FL $\rho$aveh FL , representing a density enhancement with respect to the bulk fluid, depends only weakly on temperature and is essentially independent of density. Further MD simulations suggest that the above results, nominally valid for large systems (solid in contact with semi-infinite fluid), also describe fluid-solid interfaces under considerable nanoconfinement, provided $\rho$ ave is appropriately defined.},

@article{Chen2015,
abstract = {The lack of a first-principles derivation has made the hydrodynamic boundary condition a classical issue for the past century. The fact that the fluid can have interfacial structures adds additional complications and ambiguities to the problem. Here we report the use of molecular dynamics to identify from equilibrium thermal fluctuations the hydrodynamic modes in a fluid confined by solid walls, thereby extending the application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to yield not only the accurate location of the hydrodynamic boundary at the molecular scale, but also the relevant parameter value(s) for the description of the macroscopic boundary condition. We present molecular dynamics results on two examples to illustrate the application of this approach-one on the hydrophilic case and one on the hydrophobic case. It is shown that the use of the orthogonality condition of the modes can uniquely locate the hydrodynamic boundary to be inside the fluid in both cases, separated from the molecular solid-liquid interface by a small distance $\Delta$ that is a few molecules in size. The eigenvalue equation of the hydrodynamic modes directly yields the slip length, which is about equal to $\Delta$ in the hydrophilic case but is larger than $\Delta$ in the hydrophobic case. From the decay time we also obtain the bulk viscosity which is in good agreement with the value obtained from dynamic simulations. To complete the picture, we derive the Green-Kubo relation for a finite fluid system and show that the boundary fluctuations decouple from the bulk only in the infinite-fluid-channel limit; and in that limit we recover the interfacial fluctuation-dissipation theorem first presented by Bocquet and Barrat. The coupling between the bulk and the boundary fluctuations provides both the justification and the reason for the effectiveness of the present approach, which promises broad utility for probing the hydrodynamic boundary conditions relevant to structured or elastic interfaces, as well as two-phase immiscible flows.},

@article{Troian1997,
abstract = {Modelling fluid flows past a surface is a general problem in science and engineering, and requires some assumption about the nature of the fluid motion (the boundary condition) at the solid interface. One of the simplest boundary conditions is the no-slip condition, which dictates that a liquid element adjacent to the surface assumes the velocity of the surface. Although this condition has been remarkably successful in reproducing the characteristics of many types of flow, there exist situations in which it leads to singular or unrealistic behaviour—for example, the spreading of a liquid on a solid substrate, corner flow and the extrusion of polymer melts from a capillary tube. Numerous boundary conditions that allow for finite slip at the solid interface have been used to rectify these difficulties. But these phenomenological models fail to provide a universal picture of the momentum transport that occurs at liquid/solid interfaces. Here we present results from molecular dynamics simulations of newtonian liquids under shear which indicate that there exists a general nonlinear relationship between the amount of slip and the local shear rate at a solid surface. The boundary condition is controlled by the extent to which the liquid ‘feels' corrugations in the surface energy of the solid (owing in the present case to the atomic close-packing). Our generalized boundary condition allows us to relate the degree of slip to the underlying static properties and dynamic interactions of the walls and the fluid.},

As a result, the anisotropywas found to be an important factor in the wettability of these types of crystalline solids. Using this premise as a fundamental starting point, the hydrodynamic slip in nanoconfined water was characterized using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium calculations of the slip length under low shear rate operating conditions. As was the case for the wettability analysis, the hydrodynamic slip was found to be dependent on the wetted solid surface atomic structure. Additionally, the interfacial water liquid structure was the most significant parameter to describe the hydrodynamic boundary condition. The calibration of the water-silicon interaction potential performed by matching the experimental contact angle of silicon led to the verification of the no-slip condition, experimentally reported for silicon nanochannels at low shear rates.},

Therefore, it is essential to enhance the efficiency and performance of the solar thermal systems. Nearly all of the former works conducted on the applications of nanofluids in solar energy is regarding their applications in collectors and solar water heaters. Therefore, a major part of this review paper allocated to the effects of nanofluids on the performance of solar collectors and solar water heaters from the efficiency, economic and environmental considerations viewpoints. In addition, some reported works on the applications of nanofluids in thermal energy storage, solar cells, and solar stills are reviewed. Subsequently, some suggestions are made to use the nanofluids in different solar thermal systems such as photovoltaic/thermal systems, solar ponds, solar thermoelectric cells, and so on.

We compare the spatially dependent viscosity with a local generalization of Newton's law of viscosity and the Navier-Stokes viscosity, both of which are known to suffer extreme inaccuracies for highly inhomogeneous systems. The nonlocal constitutive model calculates effective position dependent viscosities that are free from the notorious singularities experienced by applying the commonly used local constitutive model. It is simple, general, and has widespread applicability in nanofluidics where experimental measurement of position dependent transport coefficients is currently inaccessible. In principle the method can be used to predict approximate flow profiles of any arbitrary inhomogeneous system.

abstract = {Exact equations of motion for the space- and time-dependent thermodynamic coordinates of a many-body system are derived directly from the Liouville equation. This is done by definining a generalized canonical density operator depending only upon present values of the thermodynamic coordinates. This operator is used no matter how far the system is from equilibrium. An explicit expression for the entropy of a system possibly not in equilibrium is given in terms of this operator. The equation of motion for the operator is derived, and the coupled, nonlinear, integrodifferential equations of motion for the thermodynamic coordinates follow immediately.},

abstract = {We have developed a Green-Kubo relation that enables accurate calculations of friction at solid-liquid interfaces directly from equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and that provides a pathway to bypass the time-scale limitations of typical nonequilibrium MD simulations. The theory has been validated for a number of different interfaces and it is demonstrated that the liquid-solid slip is an intrinsic property of an interface. Because of the high numerical efficiency of our method, it can be used in the design of interfaces for applications in aqueous environments, such as nano- and microfluidics.},

@article{EspanolDonev2015,
abstract = {We derive a coarse-grained description of the dynamics of a nanoparticle immersed in an isothermal simple fluid by performing a systematic coarse graining of the underlying microscopic dynamics. As coarse-grained or relevant variables, we select the position of the nanoparticle and the total mass and momentum density field of the fluid, which are locally conserved slow variables because they are defined to include the contribution of the nanoparticle. The theory of coarse graining based on the Zwanzing projection operator leads us to a system of stochastic ordinary differential equations that are closed in the relevant variables. We demonstrate that our discrete coarse-grained equations are consistent with a Petrov-Galerkin finite-element discretization of a system of formal stochastic partial differential equations which resemble previously used phenomenological models based on fluctuating hydrodynamics. Key to this connection between our “bottom-up” and previous “top-down” approaches is the use of the same dual orthogonal set of linear basis functions familiar from finite element methods (FEMs), both as a way to coarse-grain the microscopic degrees of freedom and as a way to discretize the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics. Another key ingredient is the use of a “linear for spiky” weak approximation which replaces microscopic “fields” with a linear FE interpolant inside expectation values. For the irreversible or dissipative dynamics, we approximate the constrained Green-Kubo expressions for the dissipation coefficients with their equilibrium averages. Under suitable approximations, we obtain closed approximations of the coarse-grained dynamics in a manner which gives them a clear physical interpretation and provides explicit microscopic expressions for all of the coefficients appearing in the closure. Our work leads to a model for dilute nanocolloidal suspensions that can be simulated effectively using feasibly short molecular dynamics simulations as input to a FEM fluctuating hydrodynamic solver.},

@article{Khayat1989,
abstract = {In this paper we extend the previous study of flow profiles in cylindrical Couette flow of a Lennard-Jones fluid so as to include the effects of normal stresses neglected in the previous work. The flow is subject to a temperature gradient and thermoviscous effects are taken into consideration. We apply the generalized hydrodynamic equations which are provided by the modified moment method for the Boltzmann equation reported previously. The results of calculation are in good agreement with the Monte Carlo direct simulation results of K. Nanbu [Phys. Fluids 27, 2632 (1984)] and experimental data for all Knudsen numbers. The inclusion of normal stresses also brings about a new aspect to the flow properties which has not been seen before, since the flow profiles exhibit a phase-transition-like behavior as the Knudsen number increases beyond a critical value. There also appear slips in velocity at the inner cylinder wall in the supercritical regime of Knudsen number. At the critical Knudsen number the entropy production for the flow process also exhibits a singular behavior which is reminiscent of a second-order phase transition in thermodynamic systems. ? 1989 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Bocquet2007,
abstract = {The development of microfluidic devices has recently revived the interest in "old" problems associated with transport at, or across, interfaces. As the characteristic sizes are decreased, the use of pressure gradients to transport fluids becomes problematic, and new, interface driven, methods must be considered. This has lead to new investigations of flow near interfaces, and to the conception of interfaces engineered at various scales to reduce flow friction. In this review, we discuss the present theoretical understanding of flow past solid interfaces at different length scales. We also briefly discuss the corresponding phenomenon of heat transport, and the influence of surface slip on interface driven (e.g. electro-osmotic) flows.},
