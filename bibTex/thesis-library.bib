abstract = {Formally exact equations of motion satisfied by the gross variables of a macroscopic system valid far from thermal equilibrium are obtained with the aid of the new projection operator in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. These equations are used to study nonlinear shear viscosity and normal stress effects of a model incompressible fluid in the presence of a shear flow which is not necessarily small. We find that the mode-coupling mechanism responsible for the long-time tails in time-correlation functions becomes very important here also and that a simple power-series expansion in the rate of shear D therefore fails. The part of shear viscosity dependent upon the rate of shear and the normal stress effect are found to vary as |D|1/2 and |D|3/2, respectively.},

@article{Woodcock2006,
abstract = {A one-parameter model constitutive transport equation for the viscosity of the Lennard-Jones (L-J) fluid that is accurate for all equilibrium states of liquid and gas is proposed:The form of this equation is based upon the soft-sphere scaling laws for the residual density-dependent viscosity discovered originally by Ashurst and Hoover and uses their empirical coefficient (CAH). Enskog's density-independent limit theoretical term (eta0) is included to reproduce the viscosity in the limit of zero density accurately. Remaining discrepancies at low temperatures, for both gas and liquid densities, are largely removed when the linear-density Rainwater-Friend coefficient is added. The equation is comparable in accuracy to the 24-parameter empirical equation of state proposed by Rowley and Painter. Comparison with this correlation and previous MD results reveals a discrepancy near the triple point. To test the equation, new MD data for three fluid states are reported. Here, the viscosity is computed from time correlation functions resolved into the single-particle auto- and cross-correlation terms. It is found that, at high density (rho* {\textgreater} 0.8), the cross-correlations extend beyond 7sigma (molecule diameters) and oscillate in sign. This explains the wide scatter of previous MD viscosities for small L-J systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2006},

@article{Khayat1989,
abstract = {In this paper we extend the previous study of flow profiles in cylindrical Couette flow of a Lennard-Jones fluid so as to include the effects of normal stresses neglected in the previous work. The flow is subject to a temperature gradient and thermoviscous effects are taken into consideration. We apply the generalized hydrodynamic equations which are provided by the modified moment method for the Boltzmann equation reported previously. The results of calculation are in good agreement with the Monte Carlo direct simulation results of K. Nanbu [Phys. Fluids 27, 2632 (1984)] and experimental data for all Knudsen numbers. The inclusion of normal stresses also brings about a new aspect to the flow properties which has not been seen before, since the flow profiles exhibit a phase-transition-like behavior as the Knudsen number increases beyond a critical value. There also appear slips in velocity at the inner cylinder wall in the supercritical regime of Knudsen number. At the critical Knudsen number the entropy production for the flow process also exhibits a singular behavior which is reminiscent of a second-order phase transition in thermodynamic systems. ? 1989 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Morgan2004a,
abstract = {The dynamical properties of ionic melts formed from mixtures of LiCl and KCl have been studied across the full composition range in computer simulations of sufficient length to enable reliable values for such collective transport coefficients as the viscosity, conductivity, and internal mobilities to be determined reliably. Interest centers on the nontrivial concentration dependence exhibited by these transport coefficients, which agrees well with that observed experimentally, and in relating this to the strength of the association between an ion and its first coordination shell. The relationships between the various transport coefficients, such as those between the diffusion coefficient and the viscosity (Stokes-Einstein) and the conductivity (Nernst-Einstein) also exhibit composition dependences that reflect this association. The connection between the internal mobility and two measures of the coordination shell dynamics (the cage relaxation time and the self-exchange velocity) is explored; it is shown that the self-exchange velocity follows the composition and temperature dependence of the internal mobility very well. Finally, it is shown that allowing for anion polarization in the interaction model increases the mobility of all species without changing the structure of the melt discernibly, with the largest effect being found for the Li(+) ion.},

abstract = {The maximum entropy formalism developed by Jaynes determines the relevant ensemble in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics by maximising the entropy functional subject to the constraints imposed by the available information. We present an alternative derivation of the relevant ensemble based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence from equilibrium. If the equilibrium ensemble is already known, then calculation of the relevant ensemble is considerably simplified. The constraints must be chosen with care in order to avoid contradictions between the two alternative derivations. The relative entropy functional measures how much a distribution departs from equilibrium. Therefore, it provides a distinct approach to the calculation of statistical ensembles that might be applicable to situations in which the formalism presented by Jaynes performs poorly (such as non-ergodic dynamical systems). {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Is there a ‘true' geometry of the universe? Why does there appear to be an arrow of time? Do humans play a special role in the world? In this unique introductory book, Dean Rickles guides the reader through these and other core questions that keep philosophers of physics up at night. He discusses the three pillars of modern physics (quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and the theories of relativity), in addition to more cutting-edge themes such as econophysics, quantum gravity, quantum computers, and gauge theories. The book's approach is based on the idea that philosophy of physics is a kind of ‘interpretation game' in which we try to map physical theories onto our world. But the rules of this game often lead to a multiplicity of possible victors: rarely do we encounter a simple answer. The Philosophy of Physics offers a highly accessible introduction to the latest developments in this exciting field. Written in a lively style, with many visual examples, it will appeal to beginner-level students in both physics and philosophy.},

@article{Zwanzig1961,
abstract = {A new generalization of Onsager's theory of irreversible processes is presented. The main purpose is to allow for memory effects or causal time behavior, so that the response to a thermodynamic force comes later than the application of the force. This is accomplished by a statistical mechanical derivation of an exact non-Markoffian kinetic equation for the probability distribution in the space of macroscopic state variables. The memory effect in the resulting transport equations is represented by a time convolution of the thermodynamic forces with memory functions. The latter are time-correlation functions in the rates of change of the phase functions corresponding to macroscopic quantities. The resulting transport equations are not restricted to small deviations from thermal equilibrium. Onsager's theory is shown to be the low-frequency limit of our causal theory.},

The application covers a wide range of topics: the theory of diffusion and heat conduction, fluid dynamics, relaxation phenomena, acoustical relaxation, and the behavior of systems in an electromagnetic field. The statistical foundations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are treated in detail, and there are special sections on fluctuation theory, the theory of stochastic processes, the kinetic theory of gases, and the derivation of the Onsager reciprocal relations. The implications of causality conditions and of dispersion relations are analyzed in depth. Advanced students will find a great number of challenging problems, with hints for their solutions. Chemists will be especially interested in the applications to electrochemistry and the theory of chemical reactions.
